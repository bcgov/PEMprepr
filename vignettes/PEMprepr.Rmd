`PEMprepr`, short for *Predictive Ecosystem Mapping -- Preparation* is
the first of a series of packages supporting the British Columbia
Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification (BEC) Predictive Ecosystem
Mapping (PEM) project. See
[BC-BEC](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/HRE/becweb/index.html) and
[`PEMr`](https://github.com/bcgov/PEMr) on \_GitHub_for details about
the BC BEC classification system and the PEM Project.

A portion of the [Aleza Lake Research Forest](aleza.unbc.ca), one of the
pilot study sites for this project is used for this example. The area
outlined in red will be used in the steps below.

In the example below it is assumed that you are running the following
within a new R project.

```{r, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE, include=FALSE}
## this section is invisible ... just used to create the image.

aleza <- sf::st_read(system.file("extdata/aleza.gpkg", 
                                 package = "PEMprepr"), 
                     quiet = FALSE)
                     
aoi   <- sf::st_read(system.file("extdata/aleza_nw.gpkg", 
                                 package = "PEMprepr"), 
                     quiet = TRUE)

g <- ggplot() + geom_sf() +
  geom_sf(data = aleza, colour = "green", fill = "darkgreen") + 
  geom_sf(data = aoi, colour = "red", lwd = 1.5, fill = NA) + 
  labs(title = "Aleza Lake Research Forest") +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 6))

ggsave(plot = g, "./vignettes/aleza.png", dpi = 150,
       width = 4, height = 3.75)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap="The Aleza Lake Research forest with the area of interest outlined in red"}

knitr::include_graphics("/vignettes/aleza.png")
```

# Workflow

The following provides a standard workflow for preparing data for
subsequent sampling, modeling, and mapping. The key steps demonstrated
below include:

1.  Data folder set up.
2.  Alignment of the area of interest
3.  Generation of covariates
4.  Creation of a multi-resolution raster stack
5.  Collection of vector data.

# Folder setup

Data for the project can quickly become difficult to manage. To
facilitate ease of data management a standard set of folders for each
area of interest. The following creates the needed folders for the area
of interest: *aleza*. In addition, `fstr` stores a named list of the
folders created which we will utilize later (e.g. to programmatically
place results of functions in the correct place).

\_Note: if the folders have been generated previously this function will
still return the list of folder names.

```{r, results='hold'}
# creates dirs and returns a named list
fstr <- setup_folders("aleza") # relative or full path

str(fstr[1:5]) ## first 5 in the list. 
```

# Alignment of the area of interest

Load the spatial data

```{r}
aoi   <- sf::st_read(system.file("extdata/aleza_nw.gpkg", 
                                 package = "PEMprepr"), quiet = TRUE)

sf::st_bbox(aoi) ## note extent
```

One concern, with this *area-of-interest* (`aoi`) (red area) is that the
bounding box or geographic extent of the area ends with very random
numbers (output above). Using this extent will cause significant
problems later when we attempt to stack numerous rasters.

## Snap the extent

Here the `aoi` is snapped to an extent divisible by 100. This will
facilitate the generation of rasters data that all fits this grid extent
and thereby can be stacked with relative ease.

```{r}
aoi <- aoi_snap(aoi, method = "shrink") ## or expand
```

## Raster templates

The snapped `aoi` can now be used to create a raster template. In the
example below a 25m^2^ raster template is created.

```{r}
t25 <- create_template(aoi, 25)
t25 ## note that the extent of the raster is the same as the aoi. 
```

# Generation of covariates

Here we generate the terrain derived covariates. This is powered by
[SAGA-GIS](https://saga-gis.sourceforge.io/en/index.html). Covariates
are generated at multiple resolutions, for example 5, 10, and 25m^2^.

Steps to create the covariates

1.  load a digital terrain model (`dtm`). Generally, this will be a high
    resolution model derived from lidar.
2.  align the `dtm` to the template. resample the `dtm` to the desired
    resolution -- here we demonstrate using the 25m^2^ templated created
    above.
3.  create the covariates

## Import the terrain model

```{r}
dtm <- terra::rast(system.file("extdata/aleza_nw.tif",
                               package = "PEMprepr"))
dtm
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
## Invisible -- use this manually to create the graphic
library(tidyterra) ## ggplot with rasters 

g <- ggplot() + 
  geom_spatraster(data = dtm) +
  scale_fill_whitebox_c(palette = "high_relief") +
  geom_sf(data = aoi, colour = "red", lwd = 1.5, fill = NA) + 
  labs(title = "Aleza Lake RF",
       subtitle = "North-west corner",
       fill = "Elevation") + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(size = 6))

ggsave("./vignettes/aleza_aoi_dtm.png", dpi = 150, 
       height = 4, width = 5.2)
```

```{r dtm-and-aoi, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A raw digital terrain model with the area-of-interest noted in red. All processed rasters will align with the aoi."}

knitr::include_graphics("./aleza_aoi_dtm.png")
```

## Align the raster

```{r}
dtm25 <- align_raster(dtm, t25)
dtm25
```

## Create the covariates

```{r, eval=FALSE}
layer_options <- 
  c("Filled_sinks", "sinkroute", "dem_preproc", 
    "slope_aspect_curve", "tCatchment", "tca", "sCatchment", 
    "twi", "channelsNetwork", "Distance2Water", 
    "MultiResFlatness", "MultiResFlatness2",
    "MultiResFlatness3", "TRI", "convergence", "Openness",
    "dah", "TPI", "RidgeValley", "MRN", "FlowAccumulation",
    "SlopeLength", "FlowAccumulation2", "FlowAccumulation3",
    "FlowPathLength", "FlowPathLength2", "FlowPathLength3", 
    "LSFactor", "SolarRad", "Convexity", "VertDistance", "TCI_low",
    "SWI", "WindExp", "Texture", "Protection", "VRM",
    "MBI", "mscale_TPI", "RelPosition", "SlopeCurvatures",
    "SteepestSlope", "UpslopeArea")



create_covariates(dtm = dtm25,           ## raster created above
                  SAGApath = "c:/SAGA/", ## Where SAGA GIS is installed
                  output = fstr$cov_dir, ## from the setup_folders above
                  layers = "all")        ## use all or one of the above

```

Note that the pre-defined output directory `fstr$cov_dir`, created using
`setup_folders()`, is used to ensure generated covariates are saved to
the correct location. Rasters are also saved into subfolders of the same
resolution.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
l <- list.files(path = fstr$cov_dir, pattern = ".sdat",
                recursive = TRUE)
l <- l[!grepl("xml",l)]

## created covariates 
head(l, 20)

<center>*Note: As SAGA-GIS is used the files resulting files are all
saved in `.sdat` format -- this is read/writable by
`terra::rast`*</center>

# Creation of the multi-resolution raster stack

Generation of the covariates above is repeated for each resolution in
the multi-resolution model. In order to make all of the rasters
stackable, necessary for model and map generation, they must all have
the same extent and resolution.

The process above ensures they all have the same extent.

Next the coarse resolution rasters are *disaggregated* to a fine scale
resolution. This means that the data in the resulting raster is the data
of the coarse-raster but in a fine scale format.

<center>*Note: it is highly recommended to use `full.names = TRUE` to
list the files.*</center>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
## we can use the list of files from above
l <- list.files(path = fstr$cov_dir,
                pattern = ".sdat",
                full.names = TRUE, ## Use TRUE
                recursive = TRUE)
l <- l[!grepl("xml",l)]


create_fine_res(inputFileList = l[1:5],     ## using the list of files above  
                output = fstr$cov_dir, ## from setup_folders())
                targetRes = 5)

This script is a wrapper for `terra::disaggregate`.

# Collection of vector data

A standard set of Vector data is used for subsequent sample planning and
is based on the `aoi`. This script collects numerous vector layers from
the [BC Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca) making use of
the [`bcdata`](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata) package

```{r, eval=FALSE}
create_base_vectors(in_aoi = aoi,
                    out_path = fstr$shape_raw_dir)
```

files are saved in *geopackage* format.
